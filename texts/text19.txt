48-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep. No seizures observed. Reported eye tics have no ictal correlate. Normal baseline activity. No slowing or epileptiform graphoelements detected today. Normal sleep, normal organization of sleep stages. (12/2017-29-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep, with continuous MDZ administration to assess for possible subclinical seizures. Baseline activity is slightly abnormal for age due to poorer organization and lower voltages. Intermittent slowing to the delta band localized in the midline (el. Fz) and FC right (F4, Fp2, F8) is present, accentuated in sleep. The interictal abnormality is poor, mostly isolated spikes and sharp waves with a maximum in the same region as the deceleration. A total of 46 subclinical seizures/ictal patterns described above were captured from both wake and sleep, arising from the right frontal mesial region. In sleep they are without any clinical correlate.)
