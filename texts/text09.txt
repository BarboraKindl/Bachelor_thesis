Numerous epileptic seizures from wakefulness and sleep were recorded. They have a uniform onset in the form of complex partial seizures with motor phenomena, according to the semiological classification they are bilateral tonic seizures, which are invariably secondarily generalized. Their semiology reliably points to a left frontocentral onset, with susp. early involvement of mesiofrontal (SSMA) structures (abrupt onset with screaming, hunching, symmetric extensor tonic spasm of all limbs transitioning to asymmetric tonic posturing clearly lateralizing the epileptogenic zone to the left, secondary generalization with symptom number 4 and predominance of clonic twitches on the right, postictal limitation of right-sided limb mobility and persistent phatic disorder, almost complete amnesia for the seizure). Also, ictal EEG recording showed initial changes left frontocentral parasagittal, with rapid generalization. Note: The record is suggestive of localization of the epileptogenic zone frontocentrally on the left, with suspected significant involvement of the SSMA region.
