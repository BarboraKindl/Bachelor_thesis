56-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with transient reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness recording activity is normal, with no asymmetry in the occipital rhythm, with a striking constant MU rhythm asymmetry to the detriment of the right side. Areal differentiation on the left is good, disturbed on the right by irregular intermittent slowing over the broader FCTP area and especially by the presence of numerous epileptiform activity of the character of episodes of locally rhythmic or periodic (repetition rate around 1 Hz) spike and polyspike discharges apparently lateralized to the right, here with a maximum below the el. C4, less so below el. F4 and P4, non-constant and rather rare spreading below el. F8 and T4, with no tendency to leftward spreading or generalization. Sleep had a normal organization of stages in the EEG. In the shallower NREM, epileptiform activity continues to be slightly accentuated, more often polyspike in character, slightly more often propagating temporally, but the maximum FCD on the right is quite constant. In REM sleep it disappears. Numerous brief seizures exclusively from wakefulness, focal without disturbance of consciousness, seizures in activity have been recorded. Their semiology is very poor, consisting of a change in facial expression, a non-constant slight droop of the head, blinking more with the left eye and a not very conspicuous tonic prolongation of the LHK without postictal paresis; while being in contact with the environment. The ictal EEG is also quite poor, characterized by a flattening of the recording amplitude and the presence of low-voltage fast rhythmic FC activity on the right, again with a distinct peak below the el. C4, without generalization.
