Summary: 32-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep. Baseline activity intermittently corresponds to age (posterior theta), however, there is an admixture of slow delta waves, right to near continuous deceleration. MU rhythm is slightly asymmetric also to the disadvantage of the right side. In wakefulness, epileptiform activity is evident in the form of sharp waves and spikes with a maximum of TO on the right, but occasionally PTO on the right, only occasionally with a predominance of P on the right. The discharges tend to rhythmization. Sleep is with good organization, in the NREM phase there is a multiplication of epileptiform activity PTO right, which is more numerous, occasionally with propagation almost over the whole right hemisphere. The REM phase is without discharges, but there is a marked slowing of delta O on the right. There were 10 clinical and 2 subclinical seizures lasting up to 1 minute. All seizures are dominated by eye movements (twitching) to the right and slightly upward, followed by blinking, and there is also a slightly altered facial expression - up to the character of an atypical smile. In two seizures, there is an additional subtle movement of the acres and then of the entire HKK, once earlier and more pronounced on the acre of the PHK. One seizure was preceded by a spasm. The ictal EEG recording usually begins with a few seconds of braid activity, followed by sometimes better, sometimes worse expressed rhythmic spike wave (P)TO activity on the right with increasing frequency, with slow high voltage delta activity over other areas of the right and left hemispheres. After the seizure, a shorter stretch of slow delta activity is usually seen with predominance to the right posteriorly.
