80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with partial reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness activity is slightly diffusely slower due to age, with minimal evidence of regional FC slowing on the left. In the same localization (FC left), there are occasional lower sharp waves without generalization. Sleep has normal organization in the EEG, with single higher SW complexes appearing in non-REM, inconsistently with a polyspike component, with left hemisphere predominance and incomplete generalization. Numerous more or less semiologically uniform sleep and wakefulness seizures were recorded, according to the international classification simplex partial, according to the semiological classification probably of focal spasms character (slowing of PM pace, sometimes raising the PHK above the head, inconspicuous spasms proximal to the PHK, without disturbance of consciousness). The ictal EEG correlate is slow rhythmic activity localized distinctly FC left, the correlate of PHK twitches is a sharp wave over the left hemisphere with incomplete generalization.
