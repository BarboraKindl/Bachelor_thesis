80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with transient reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is slower due to age, less well differentiated bilaterally, but with a predominance of slowing, including the occurrence of higher irregular theta/delta episodes with peak amplitude and slow FT activity on the left. There are mostly less frequent lower sharp waves and less frequent spikes localized with a clear predominance of F left (max F3, less Fp1, F7, with occasional formation of shorter episodes), with propagation over the wider FTP region left and less F right, but always without complete generalization. Isolated occurrence of independent low-voltage OV O left. Sleep has a normal organization of stages in the EEG. Frequency and localization of epileptiform activity do not change significantly in NREM, epileptiform activity disappears in REM sleep. Three epileptic seizures from sleep were recorded, semiologically focal motor seizures with disturbance of consciousness, without much doubt from the left hemisphere (awakening, change of facial expression, PHK dystonia, bilat. Automatisms, restlessness, poor vocalization, complete amnesia for seizure). In the EEG, once preceded by a longer preictal pattern convincingly localized left frontally (below el. F3), otherwise alternating flattening and inconspicuous rhythmic activity from the beta band again F sin., then a late slow rhythmic pattern over most of the left hemisphere even with minor propagation to the right; postictal slowing again F left. Note In summary, the record is suggestive of localization of the epileptogenic zone left frontally, with some evidence of propagation to more distant regions.
