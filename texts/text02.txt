2/13 One brief epileptic seizure was recorded shortly after falling asleep. It has a poor and difficult to classify semiology (waking, anxiety, blinking, mild tremor, limited reactivity, no other manifestations). The ictal EEG pattern consists of rhythmic steep waves rather than spikes, again localized over a broad FCTP area of the left hemisphere, with some maximum below the el. F7. Note: The seizure semiology and EEG findings are consistent with previous (i.e. preoperative) video/EEG recordings; indicating localization of the epileptogenic zone in the deeper (v.s. operculo-insular) regions of the left hemisphere.
