56-hour video EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep. Baseline activity over left hmsf completely normal, no independent epilepiform activity. Focal EEG status epilepticus dominates on the right frontally (max. below el.F4 and Fz), with only minor spread over other regions, but clearly disrupting the organization of the recording (MU rhythm is almost absent on the right, occipital rhythm is slightly disrupted). Focal status epilepticus continues in NREM sleep, where characteristic polyspike and PSW complexes appear, in the same localization. On the left, the sleep organization is preserved. In REM sleep, epileptiform activity almost disappears. Numerous seizures with a marked predominance from sleep have been recorded. The girl recognizes the seizure from wakefulness one second ahead probably from the sensation when her eyes roll up (described by the subj. as vertigo). These are asymmetric tonic seizures with preserved consciousness. Their character shows localization of the epileptigenic zone in the right hmsf, near the frontal eye field and SSMA area ( eye roll upwards to the left, fencing posture to the left, sometimes with L corner of the mouth spasm, vocalization, sometimes atypical laughter at the end, fully preserved consciousness). Ictal EEG also clearly localizes the epileptigenic zone to the right frontally.
