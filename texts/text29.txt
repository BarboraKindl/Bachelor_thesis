96-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with temporary reduction of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT scanning. Baseline activity is strikingly slower due to age, poorly differentiated and limited reactivity, with polymorphic slowing over both hemispheres, appearing both over the posterior quadrants and anteriorly (sometimes char. FIRTA), with multiple generalized episodes of irregular theta/delta without constant localization/lateralization. Epileptiform activity is numerous from wake and sleep, consisting of polymorphic sharp waves, spikes and irregular SW complexes with variable localization but with a noticeable maximum under the el. P4. In NREM sleep, discharges are more often generalized, disrupting sleep organization, and longer episodes of slow rhythmic v.s. epileptiform FCP activity in the midline appear, without clear lateralization. However, even in the majority of NREM stages and REM sleep, a maximum of P discharges on the right is evident. Three uniform seizures were recorded, focal with transition to FBTCS, with semiology lateralizing the epileptogenic zone without much doubt to the right hemisphere (eye and head upward clonic version, tonic spasm of the LHK, transition to bilateral seizure with clear left-sided predominance). The ictal EEG is always characterized by a rhythmic preictal pattern clearly dominated by P on the right (max. below el. P4, less so T6), followed by diffuse flattening with superimposed fast rhythmic activity over the right hemisphere and in the midline, with subsequent transition to higher slow rhythmic activity predominating on the left (no clear localization), ending in diffuse postictal slowing.
