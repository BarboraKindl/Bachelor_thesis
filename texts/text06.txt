80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep 11/2018 - with temporary reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness activity recording is normal. There is a not very noticeable but nearly continuous slowing regionally frontal left, with a peak below the el. F3. Numerous epileptiform activity is present in the same region. These are single spikes, but more often irregular SW complexes and polyspike episodes, all with a distinct maximum below el. F3, with lesser propagation below el. F7 and Fz, always without generalization. Sleep had preserved stage organization in the EEG. In NREM, the mentioned epileptiform abnormality, mainly of polyspike character, multiplies, while in REM it disappears, its localization remaining constant. One nonspecific cephalic aura from wakefulness and four uniform focal seizures from sleep, hyperkinetic without disturbance of consciousness, were recorded. It is a type II HMS, originating clearly from the left hemisphere: bipedal and "swinging" automatisms, without vocalizations and a distinct emotional component, with a striking extensor tonic spasm of the PHK and head-to-right version, followed by an unnatural smile, vegetative symptoms (tachycardia), with short duration. The ictal EEG is consistent with the interictal findings, invariably starting with a preictal pattern of the same nature as the polyspikes in the NREM, continuing with a braiding and recruitment rhythmic pattern from the c. alpha band, again localized distinctly with a peak below the el. F3.
