56-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep without reduction of antiepileptic therapy.The baseline wakefulness activity is borderline frequency (occipital rhythm 8 Hz) due to age, imperfectly organized due to diffuse light admixture of slower waves, but with no clear asymmetry and no demonstrable epileptiform activity in wakefulness. Sleep had a slightly atypical organization of stages in the EEG. In NREM sleep (shallow and deep), slow and steep waves appear bilaterally frontally, more to the right, with variable propagation - not typical epileptiform activity, but not physiological sleep transients either; could be mitigated discharges. Of the epileptiform activity, there are only very subtle lower sharp waves frontally to the right in NREM, with a maximum below the el. F4; only quite rarely was a spike seen - all without generalization. Numerous uniform seizures with predominance from sleep, focal without disturbance of consciousness, tonic were captured. Their character without much doubt points to an onset in the frontal eye field of the right hemisphere (tonic version first of the eyes and then of the head to the left, followed by an asymmetric tonic posturing of the limbs to the left, without disturbance of consciousness, without postictal motor and fatal deficits). Ictal EEG is consistent with this localization hypothesis, showing a non-constant preictal pattern in the form of rapid rhythmic FC activity on the right and in the midline, with a peak below the el. F4, with a subsequent diffuse flattening of the recording amplitude and a late already slow rhythmic pattern over a wide region of the right hemisphere and with contralateral propagation. Postictal deceleration only briefly FCT on the right.
