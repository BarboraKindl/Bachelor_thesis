80-hour video/EEG monitoring with reduction of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT scanning. Baseline recording activity is within the broad limits of normal, with somewhat worse differentiation over the left hemisphere, intermittent left FCP slowing near the midline. There are numerous bursts of sharp FC waves in wakefulness and very frequent bursts in NREM sleep in the midline or left, without complete generalization, including their rhythmic episodes. Sleep was disorganized by the presence of very frequent epileptiform activity, but the discharges disappear in REM sleep. Numerous semiologically uniform seizures almost exclusively from sleep were recorded. They can be classified as complex partial seizures with motor phenomena and automatisms according to the international classification and as hypermotor or tonic seizures according to the semiological classification. Their character points to a source in the left hemisphere, v.s. frontally (tonic or dystonic posturing of the PHK, pelvic and hypermotor automatisms, later version of eyes and head to the right, no emotional agitation in the face and no vocalizations; i.e., type II hypermotor seizures). Ictal EEG is significantly superimposed by artifacts during movements; however, the preictal rhythmic pattern is clearly localized FC in the midline and left. Note: Monitoring is entirely consistent with the previous recording; it shows localization of the epileptogenic zone in the frontocentral (premotor) region of the left hemisphere, near the midline
