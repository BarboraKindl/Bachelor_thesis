72-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with transient reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity over the right hemisphere is within age-normal limits, with good occipital rhythm over the left hemisphere but generally poorer differentiation, especially in the FC region. There are numerous and almost continuous bursts of spikes and SW complexes localized left frontally in wakefulness and in NREM sleep. During monitoring, electrodes were replaced - caps replaced with glued electrodes. Before replacement, focus localized clearly below the el. F7, after it more anteriorly, below el. Fp1, F3, less F7. Always without generalization and contralateral propagation. Sleep was basically organized, but with numerous ongoing epileptiform activity, which in REM clearly focalizes under el. F7. A larger seizure (tonic) was not detected. From NREM sleep, ictal recruitment patterns emerged according to EEG, emanating from the same region as the interictal activity, with spread over the left hemisphere, but without clinical correlate (i.e., "ictal-like" episodes). From sleep, small myoclonias were observed on the right-sided limbs, more on the PDK, with imprecise or unclear correlation with EEG findings (EEG correlate is an abnormal K-complex with a spike component rather than a more prominent discharge).
