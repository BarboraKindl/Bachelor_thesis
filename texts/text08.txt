Video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep during epileptic seizure buying, on i.v. therapy. The baseline activity recording is conspicuously slowed down relative to age, minimally organized, limited reactivity, no clear localized slowing, with the presence of rhythmic episodes of sharp waves or spikes of "ictal-like" character localized fronto-temporally bilaterally, with a maximum below the el. F7 and F8; the initiation of this activity appears from the scalp EEG to be more from the right hemisphere. Sleep was significantly disorganized by the presence of these rhythmic patterns (maximum occurrence in NREM sleep) and the periodic nature of the recording in some sleep segments. Very numerous epileptic seizures were recorded with a predominance from sleep. According to the international classification they are simplex partial seizures with automatisms, according to the semiological classification they combine elements of hypermotor, automotor and autonomic seizures. Their semiology firstly points to a possible orbitofrontal localization of the epileptogenic zone (anxiety, grimacing, vegetative symptoms including frequent bedwetting, hint of hypermotor automatisms, vocalization, oroalimentary automatisms towards the end, fully conscious). Ictal EEG patterns are non-lateralized, with braiding and bilateral rhythmic ictal activity from the alpha band. Note: Based on video/EEG monitoring, we infer an orbitofrontal localization of the epileptogenic zone. Its lateralization is not possible from ictal manifestations and EEG; rather, we judge its location in the right hemisphere based on interictal changes.
