80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep without reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness activity is within the broad limits of the age-norm, organized, reactive, with intermittent slowing of lower amplitude fronto-temporal left. There are single bursts of sharp waves and spikes regionally FT left - maximum amplitude below el. F7 and F9, propagation below el. T3, in wakefulness without generalization. In NREM sleep there is multiplication, propagation frontally and to the right, generalization is not complete. NREM stages and REM sleep can be well differentiated, the occurrence of sleep transients is physiological, but some NREM sections are significantly affected by numerous epileptiform activity. In REM sleep, the discharges disappear. Numerous focal seizures with a significant predominance from sleep (only once from wakefulness) were observed. These are short asymmetric tonic seizures; due to their duration and the age of the child, it is not possible to comment unequivocally on the state of consciousness during the seizure, but immediately after the end the boy is in contact. Semiology suggests an onset in the left hemisphere with a rapid contralateral spread (initial spasm of the LHK acro, but later posturing with PHK extension and LHK flexion, slight hunching, sometimes in a shorter series of multiple bursts in succession). The ictal EEG is fully consistent with the interictal findings, showing a variably expressed rhythmic pattern with a constant FT peak on the left, spreading more over the left hemisphere, also postictal slowing on the left.
