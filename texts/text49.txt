96-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with temporary withdrawal of anti-seizure medication. Clinical epileptic seizure was not detected. During falling asleep and sleep, the mother observed occasional very mild irregular twitching of the LHK acre, mostly of the thumb - this could not be verified from the video recording. Baseline activity over the left hemisphere is within the age normal range, with a well reactive occipital to 9 Hz alpha rhythm as well as a central MU rhythm that is slower and irregular compared to the occipital rhythm. There is also a well-formed symmetrical occipital rhythm on the right, but a continuous epileptiform abnormality fronto-central to character mitigated EEG status epilepticus clearly dominates. It is a combination of slow rhythmic activity with numerous lower sharp waves and spikes. The localization of this abnormality is FC mesially and at the convexity: the maximum amplitude is below the el. F4, but spikes also appear below el. Fz, Cz and C4. Virtually without contralateral propagation and in wakefulness without tendency to generalization. The sleep EEG had essentially normal organization of the stages and the presence of physiological transients. However, the epileptiform abnormality of the FC on the right - in NREM in the form of episodes of already unambiguous focal EEG status epilepticus under el. F4, then C4, Fz, only minor propagation under el. Fp2 and Cz. Other than that, single generalized higher spikes and short SW complexes also appear in shallower NREM - but still with obvious FC dx. amplitude maxima. However, sleep organization is not significantly disrupted by this abundant epileptiform activity.
