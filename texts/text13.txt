Conclusion: 80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with partial reduction of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT scanning. Baseline recording activity is slower and less well differentiated due to age, with MU rhythm asymmetry to the detriment of the left side, numerous polymorphic slowing predominantly FCP left and CT right and generalization, with very frequent epileptiform activity predominantly FCP left, including longer rhythmic episodes of SW complexes, and less independently CT right. Left-sided discharges often generalize. In sleep, epileptiform activity becomes generalized, has high voltages, replaces K-complexes and spindles, completely disrupts sleep organization, and is periodic in places. Numerous waking and sleeping seizures have been recorded. The wakefulness seizures are short (second) simplex partial seizures with tonic spasm of the PHK fingers, while the sleep seizures are asymmetric tonic seizures with right-sided lateralization, maximal at the PHK. The ictal EEG pattern in longer seizures consists of diffuse amplitude flattening preceded by rhythmic FCP spikes on the left, followed by a rhythmic pattern over the coincident FCP region of the left hemisphere.
