80-hour video/EEG monitoring with partial reduction of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT examination. Baseline wakefulness activity is normal, there is intermittent slowing over the broader fronto-temporal region of the left hemisphere with propagation to the right frontally and discharges of rather lower sharp waves and fewer spikes in the same localization (i.e., broader FT sin. area), including the occurrence of their rhythmic episodes, all without generalization. In NREM sleep, the frequency and amplitude of the discharges increase slightly, they are still localized FT left. Sleep organization is preserved. We detected relatively numerous stereotyped epileptic seizures from wakefulness and sleep; according to the semiological classification, these are hypermotor seizures. They are characterized by a change in facial expression, prominent loud vocalization, sometimes hyperventilation, bipedal automatisms, leftward twisting of the trunk to gyration and general restlessness; consciousness is fully preserved. Ictal EEG recording is relatively poor; it clearly lateralizes the epileptogenic zone to the left hemisphere, but does not allow differentiation of frontal or temporal onset (rather slow rhythmic activity over the broader FT sin. area, significantly overlaid by artifacts). Note: The recording is consistent with previous monitoring; it indicates the localization of the epileptogenic zone in deeper structures of the left hemisphere - taking into account the semiology of seizures, interictal and ictal EEG findings, we consider the primary source in frontomesial (cingulate) structures; however, the involvement of temporopolar and operculo-insular structures cannot be completely excluded.
