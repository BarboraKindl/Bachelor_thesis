Short semiologically uniform epileptic seizures were recorded exclusively from sleep, which according to the international classification can be described as simplex partial with motor phenomena and according to the semiological classification as bilateral tonic. Their semiology is suspected from the localization of the epileptogenic zone mesially, more probably on the right (non-constant predominance of tonic spasm and subsequent twitches on the LHK). Ictal EEG supports the hypothesis of a midline localization of the epileptogenic zone, most probably frontocentrally.
