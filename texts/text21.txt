80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with partial reduction of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT scanning. Baseline activity is slower, less organized and reactive due to age, with multiple intermittent slowing predominating over the broader FCTP region of the left hemisphere. There are very inconspicuous low-voltage sharp waves and spikes with peaks below the el. C3, but again over the wider FCTP region of the left hemisphere, with occasional bilateral propagation, without generalization. Sleep had a normal organization of stages, with accentuation of epileptiform activity in NREM sleep, with occasional hints of low-voltage polyspikes. There were numerous semiologically uniform seizures exclusively from sleep, according to the international classification simplex partial with motor phenomena, according to the semiological classification tonic. Their character suggests a source in the left hemisphere, v.s. near the motor (rather caudal) and speech areas; their opercular (rather than insular) origin cannot be excluded (uncertain aura, susp. Ictal EEG pattern is based on CT of the left hemisphere with rapid bilateral spread.
