Conclusion: 80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with transient reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is within the broader limits of normal in frequency but imperfect, less well organized, with continuous slowing to theta/delta band localized left frontally with contralateral propagation. There are also numerous bursts of irregular sharp waves, spikes and shorter SW complexes localized over a broader area frontally to the left in wakefulness with discontinuous CTP propagation to the left and F to the right, without generalization. In NREM sleep, the frequency and amplitude of the discharges increase significantly, having the character of high-voltage generalized SW and PSW complexes. They grossly disturb the sleep organization and have up to periodic character. Difficult to classify seizures clinically with epileptic spasms (with vocalization, arm elevation, left head curl) were recorded, preceded in EEG by a recruitment pattern clearly starting left frontally.
