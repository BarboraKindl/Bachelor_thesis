80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with transient reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness activity is organized and reactive, with borderline occipital rhythm frequency and poorer organization over the right hemisphere. There is an almost continuous and sometimes rhythmic slowing over the broader frontal to fronto-temporal region of the right hemisphere, with a maximum frontobasally. Also over the broader frontal-right region, single and rhythmic bursts of sharp waves and spikes appear in wakefulness and in sleep, with a marked tendency to generalization in the form of higher irregular SW complexes. Sleep was significantly disorganized by epileptiform activity, and the recording has a periodic character due to the presence of longer episodes of epileptiform activity. Away from the character of the sleep abnormality, episodes of slow rhythmic activity alternated inconsistently with spikes of higher generalized SW, PSW and polyspike complexes, still with a noticeable initiation from the right frontally. Semiologically uniform focal seizures with disturbance of consciousness, always from wakefulness, once in a shorter buy. The girl gives aura of pressure in the chest and epigastrium, objectively we observe a frown, change of facial expression, brief automatisms (posturing, purposeless movements of the HKK without lateralization), rather late OAA, unmotivated smile, then in verbal contact, sometimes briefly confused. Ictal EEG patterns are characterized by braiding and the presence of rapid rhythmic activity over a large area of the right hemisphere, more frontally, with almost immediate generalization - thus, consistent with interictal EEG findings, may suggest broader epileptogenic zones right frontally or rapid propagation of epileptogenic activity from deeper right hemisphere structures (e.g. operculo-insular?)
