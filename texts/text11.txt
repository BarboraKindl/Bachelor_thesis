Baseline recording activity in wakefulness is normal, with no obvious localized slowing, or only a minimal admixture of lower slower waves centrally in the midline. There are single sharp waves and fewer spikes centrally in the midline, with shorter generalized irregular SW complexes only in drowsiness. Sleep had a normal organization of individual stages in the EEG. In NREM sleep there was a significant increase in sharp waves and spikes centrally in the midline, with only isolated generalization or spread to other regions. Several semiologically uniform epileptic seizures from sleep were captured; the strongest of these (with a tendency to secondary generalization) had radionuclide applied during ictal SPECT examination. These were simplex partial tonic seizures according to the international classification and asymmetric bilateral tonic seizures according to the semiological classification. Their character indicates an onset in the left hemisphere (susp. Initial sensation in the right shoulder or neck, then spasm first on the acre of the PHK with transition to asymmetric tonic posture with flexion of the PHK, extension of the LHK, head first non-tonically curled to the left shoulder, then with a late version to the right, after a prolonged seizure with a pronounced right-sided Todd's hemiparesis with a maximum on the PHK, without apparent postictal fatal disturbance). Ictal EEG pattern in shorter seizures is non-lateralized, in longer seizure with late ictal slow rhythmic activity localized CP left and left-sided postictal slowing.
