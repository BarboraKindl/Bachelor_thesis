104-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with partial reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is entirely within age-normal limits, only intermittently suggesting asymmetry in MU rhythm to the detriment of the right side and also intermittently observing a greater admixture of slower frequencies on the right with a peak in the FC region. Two completely independent sources of interictal epileptiform activity appear: (1) single moderate spikes on the left occipitally (below el. O1), without generalization; (2) infrequent slow and steep FC waves on the right below el. F4 and C4, but with a clear tendency to occur in slow rhythmic episodes around 1-2 Hz, varying in prominence from rhythmic slowing to pathognomonic rhythmic patterns of a preictal nature, also with virtually no propagation to other regions. Sleep had a normal organization of stages in the EEG as well as the presence of all physiological transients. In the shallower NREM, the discharges proliferate significantly, especially occipitally to the left - they are numerous, still regional, but clearly non-rhythmic. The slow rhythmic episodes of FC on the right are only slightly multiplied and accentuated; however, their significantly epileptiform to ictal character is significant. Two epileptic seizures from wakefulness were captured, perhaps classifiable as focal tonic, without disturbance of consciousness. They are characterized by a change in facial expression, tonic withdrawal of the left corner of the mouth, transient expressive phthisis, and mild tachycardia. There is a preictal rhythmic pattern of FC on the right (still el. F4 and C4) lasting tens of seconds, followed by a not very striking rather slow pattern over this area with transition to slow activity and with postictal accentuation of the slow rhythmic activity described above.
