80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep without reduction of antiepileptic therapy, with ictal SPECT examination. Baseline wakefulness activity is within normal limits in frequency, but with numerous intermittent FC slowing bilaterally with a maximum centrally in the midline, where wakefulness also has a maximum of very frequent and almost continuous epileptiform activity in the form of irregular spikes and shorter SW complexes in wakefulness, and generalized polyspike and PSW complexes in sleep. The discharges originate from the central midline region, propagate bilaterally with a strong element of secondary bilateral synchrony. Epileptiform activity disrupts sleep organization.
