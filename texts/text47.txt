A 6-hour video EEG wakefulness monitoring was performed. The interictal EEG is abnormal for almost sustained slowing and numerous spikes under the el. C3. Nine uniform focal right-sided tonic seizures with no apparent disturbance of consciousness are noted. Ictal EEG findings begin with FC bilat. encirclement, sometimes followed by a subtle onset of rhythmic C- FC sin activity. Given the interictal findings and seizure semiology, the epileptogenic area is most likely FC sin.
