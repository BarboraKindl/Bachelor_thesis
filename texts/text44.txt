80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with temporary withdrawal of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is within normal frequency limits and well reactive, but is less well differentiated due to intermittent admixture of irregular slower waves, worse over the right hemisphere. There are episodes of rhythmic deceleration into the theta band with distinct midline localization, maxima below the el. Cz (less Fz), variable propagation more to the right, not having the typical FIRTA pattern. It is also evident that lower irregular abnormal activity consisting of both slower waves and fast activity from the beta band is present over a wider area frontally to the right. There are also sharp waves and spikes rather sporadically at wakefulness. The pathological fast rhythmic activity is localized more anteriorly below the el. Fp2, F4 and Fz, individual sharp waves and spikes and their shorter rhythmic episodes more below el. F8. All without generalization, with low voltages. Sleep had a normal organization of stages in the EEG. With a predominance in shallower NREM, the epileptiform abnormality is accentuated, again polymorphic in nature - abnormal fast oscillations, single sharp waves, spikes, SW complexes and episodes of repetitive spikes. All over the broader frontal region on the right, still without generalization. Two semiologically poor seizures from sleep were recorded, probably with automatisms according to the current classification, without the possibility of specifying the state of consciousness (sudden awakening, rolling over on the back, looking around with a frightened expression, tachycardia, hyperventilation, once with automatisms on the acre of PHK). Ictal EEG conclusively localized the onset of seizures to the right frontally (wider area below el. Fp2, F4, Fz and Cz).
