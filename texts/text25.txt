32-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep without reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is frequency within the age-normal range (symmetrical occipital rhythm around 8 Hz), less organized over the right hemisphere, with inconsistent MU rhythm asymmetry to the detriment of the right side, and the presence of only very subtle intermittent FCP slowing on the right. Interictal epileptiform activity is very infrequent both in wakefulness and sleep. In wakefulness, there was only a very isolated episode of rhythmic sharp waves of CP lasting seconds in the midline (below el. Cz and Pz, with propagation to the right most below el. C4) without generalization. Sleep had the usual organization of individual stages in the EEG. In NREM sleep there are not very numerous sharp and steep waves rather than spikes again CP in the midline and to the right; they do not disturb the sleep organization. Two epileptic seizures from sleep have been recorded; they can probably be classified as focal clonic, with disturbance of consciousness. Their essential characteristic is their very long duration (up to 15 minutes in both cases) and relatively unobtrusive clinical manifestations. In both cases, after minutes of duration of the ictal EEG pattern, first awakening, then only very brief clonic L arm twitches, followed by a long phase with contact disturbance, atypical movements of the LHK acre (neither twitches nor automatisms, rather restlessness, only speculating about eventual sensory perception in the child???) and occasional quiet vocalizations ("e,e,e"). Postictally tired. The ictal EEG is characterized by a very well localized slow rhythmic pattern of 2-3 Hz sustained below the el. Cz, Pz and C4, without spreading to other regions.
