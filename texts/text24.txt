80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with temporary withdrawal of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is within age-normal limits, with numerous intermittent slowing and the occurrence of both single and rhythmic sharp waves and less frequently spikes regionally frontal to the right, with contralateral propagation, without generalization. Less frequent independent inferior spikes also appear FC left. Sleep had a normal organization of stages in the EEG. In NREM, there is very frequent often rhythmic epileptiform activity still regionally F right (el. Fp2 and F4), including polyspike occurrence, still without generalization. Very frequent brief paroxysmal awakenings with an ictal EEG pattern analogous to clinical seizures were recorded. Furthermore, semi-stereotypic seizures from wakefulness and sleep were also captured, which we classify as hypermotor type I (initially grimacing, sometimes with frightened expression, then bizarre pelvic and bipedal automatisms, concomitant with the appearance of dystonic posturing on the LHK, sometimes with vocalizations). Ictal EEG patterns localize without doubt the seizure onset zone to the right frontally (initially Fp2, then F4, then spreading).
