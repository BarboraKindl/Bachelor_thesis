Numerous epileptic seizures were observed with a predominance of sleep. Semiologically, they have elements of tonic and hypermotor seizures (aura in the form of a sensation in the mouth, then frightened expression, trismus, non-constant tonic spasm of PHK, swinging hypermotor automatisms, vocalizations, without disturbance of consciousness and distinct postictal aphasia). Thus, their semiology clearly lateralizes the epileptogenic zone to the left hemisphere, most likely to the operculo-insular region given the nature of the aura.
