80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with temporary withdrawal of antiepileptic therapy and ictal SPECT examination. Baseline activity over the right hemisphere is within the age-normal range, the alpha rhythm has a slight asymmetry to the detriment of the left hemisphere, where there is intermittent slowing over the posterior quadrant (TPO area), which is strongly accentuated postictally (even tens of minutes after the seizure). Also predominantly postictal, single sharp waves localized TPO on the left with a maximum below the el. T5, without generalization. Only at falling asleep then several short generalized SW complexes were detected. Sleep has an otherwise normal organization of stages and epileptiform activity does not increase in it. Complex partial seizures preceded by a visual aura and provoked incessantly by light (e.g., shining a flashlight in the eyes) have been detected. The boy subjectively reports a sensation of "rolling of the eyes" and unconstant darkness in front of the eyes. Objectively, a marked mydriasis with areactivity is observed, without other distinct manifestations (i.e. no convulsions, automatisms, other vegetative changes). Postictally, no fatal disorder. Ictal EEG shows a slow rhythmic pattern temporo-parietal left with incomplete generalization.
