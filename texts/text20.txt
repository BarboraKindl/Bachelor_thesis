Conclusion: 80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with dose reduction of antiepileptic drugs and ictal SPECT examination. Baseline wakefulness activity is normal, irregular and rhythmic slowing occurs with a peak frontally on the left and less CP on the left. We identify rhythmic episodes of abrupt and sharp waves of epileptiform character that multiply significantly in NREM sleep, not generalized. Sleep has an overall preserved organization of stages. One epileptic seizure was recorded after awakening from sleep, semiologically hypermotor type I, without disturbance of consciousness. Its semiology is most suggestive of activation of cingulate structures (unspecified aura, frightened expression, mydriasis, bipedal automatisms, vocalizations). Ictal EEG is poor, but localizes the epileptogenic zone left frontally, in accordance with the interictal findings.
