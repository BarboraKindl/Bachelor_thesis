56-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep in seizure buy treated with massive polytherapy including continuous midazolam. Baseline activity recording is slow, poorly organized, and limited reactive due to age, with the presence of v.s. pharmacogenic beta. A near-continuous rhythmic epileptiform abnormality frontal to the right (with a maximum frontopolar) predominates. In sleep, this abnormality is still evident; sleep had a disrupted organization with a non-constant tendency to periodicity of recording. A series of semiologically quite uniform focal seizures was recorded. Their character indicates a right frontal onset (susp. aura, prominent tremor, vegetative changes including flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, leftward curling of the eyes and head, rather late tonic spasm of the LHK, vocalization, cyanosis towards the end, with only partial disturbance of consciousness, without postictal fatal disturbance). Ictal EEG in agreement with clinic and interictal EEG reliably localizes the epileptogenic zone to the right frontally.
