80-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep with reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline activity is strikingly low-voltage, within age-normal limits. There is a not very prominent intermittent left temporal slowing in wakefulness and few frequent left-sided (antero)temporal spike discharges. Epileptiform activity is markedly accentuated in NREM sleep, when it is almost continuous, remains localized in the left-sided anterotemporal region, and does not significantly disrupt sleep organization. One epileptic seizure from wakefulness was recorded. It is a complex partial seizure according to the international and an automotor seizure according to the semiological classification. Its semiology localizes the epileptogenic zone to the mesiotemporal region of the left hemisphere without much doubt (impaired consciousness with complete amnesia, restlessness, early oroalimentary automatisms, PHK immobility and LHK automatisms, non-tonic deviation of the head to the left). The left lateralization of speech centers can be questioned (he speaks correctly during and just after the seizure). Ictal EEG is without typical lateralized rhythmic activity, but the presence of a slow delta in agreement with the clinic suggests a left-sided temporal localization of the epileptogenic zone.
