64-hour video/EEG monitoring of wakefulness and sleep without reduction of antiepileptic therapy. Baseline wakefulness activity is mildly abnormal for age due to asymmetry of occipital rhythm to the detriment of the right side, with numerous variably localized slowing with peak FCP on the right. In the same localization (FCP on the right), sharp waves and spikes without generalization typically appear before the seizure. Sleep has normal organization in the EEG, with no significant increase in epileptiform activity. Numerous, more or less semiologically uniform seizures from both sleep and wakefulness were recorded, according to the international classification of simplex partial, according to the semiological classification of simplex motor (L eyelid twitches, LHK, non-constant twitches and P eyelid twitches, without disturbance of consciousness). The ictal EEG correlate is rhythmic activity localized distinctly FC left with a maximum under the el. C4 or F4 or P4.
